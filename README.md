MultiTouch-Browser
==================

This simple browser is designed to test (or show off, respectively) the capabilities of [WebView-MultiTouch-PolyFill (WMP)](https://github.com/Philzen/WebView-MultiTouch-Polyfill), a library to re-create the otherwise missing multitouch functionality on most android 2.x phones.
